      // const and let can't be declared after it is used, it should have to be declared before it, but declaration using var is hoisted(i.e., point to top only, means we can declare anywhere and use it even before declaring it), but the assignment of var is not hoisted (means, if we allot value to var after using it, it give the value undefined rather than using the value)

      // var can be redeclared and reinitialized, let can be reinitialized but can't be redeclared, const neither redeclared nor reinitialized

      // var is function scoped, but let and const are block scoped

      // nothing mentioned it means it is var
